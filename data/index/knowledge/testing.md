- I became interested in testing after meeting a company manager at a musical folk event: 
    - While playing instruments together, he recommended **Playwright** to me for web site testing
- I learned how to:
    - **Collect data from coverage**
    - Create **E2E tests** and **component tests** 
- In my spare time I test various sites, currently:  
    - [**MealDrop**](https://github.com/yannbf/mealdrop) - to better understand testing from the perspective of someone with no experience in **React**
