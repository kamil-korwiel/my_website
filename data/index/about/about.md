# About Me
I was born in Poland and developed an interest in technology at an early age. As a teenager, I had my first contact with video games, which I enjoyed playing with friends. As video games often have very beautiful soundtracks, I started to get more involved with music and taught myself to play the guitar to recreate them. It was during this time that my passion for sounds, rhythm and the shared experience of music developed, which is now reflected in the projects I have pursued in my private life.

My technical college deepened my interest in information technology and my determination to study it. With the aim of combining my future with music and computer science to earn a living, I began to study information technology at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete my studies because I couldn't find a job that would have allowed me to earn a living in the city.

With the idea of temporarily pausing my studies and resuming them at a later date, I moved to Wroclaw and took on various jobs that were unrelated to my personal interests.

This led me to revisit old project ideas and slowly implement them with the knowledge I had gained from the Technikum, IT studies and self-study.

During this time, my focus changed. While making IT my daily hobby, I started to get involved in theater. I acted in various plays and acquired a sound knowledge of theater technology, audio and acting. Eventually, I realized that I enjoy communicating with other people and that creating together fulfills me.
